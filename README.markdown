# Usage
	
```javascript
$('#container').suggest(
  'source': ["ActionScript", "AppleScript", "Asp", ...]
);
```

```html
<input type="text" name="search" id="search" class="search" />
```

Check out the [demo here](http://polarblau.github.com/suggest/).

The plugin will generate the CSS required based on the input's styles.
	
This plugin currently doesn't support remote resources for haystacks for performance reasons. This might change in the future.
